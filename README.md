FINAL TODOs:

- [ ] tie the python to the ajax. 

- [ ] style fix: when a thing is dragged, it is default jQuery accordion thingy

- [x] style fix: email dialog. just need to fill out a class for that one.

- [ ] tone the button colors a bit down. we'll be demoing on a projector screen that's
going to be MUCH brighter than our computers.  

- [ ] if Polina feels up for it, a search feature (probs not, though...)
