FRONTEND TODOs:

make and maintain a JSON object that's 
specific to the user that would hold all info for the 
lists that a given user is subscribed to. this can be as 
simple as a listing of some ID of the lists.

a JSON that would have the full list of 
all lists, with their ID + name + description. May choose
to populate dynamically the lists, instead of hardcoding.

enable dragging from one list to the other, update the 
user JSON with this.

sorting by different categories.

search feature.


BACKEND TODOs:
